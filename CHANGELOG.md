# Changelog

- We use the [GOV.UK versioning guidelines](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/publishing-a-ruby-gem.html#versioning).
- Mark breaking changes with `BREAKING:`. Be sure to include instructions on how applications should be upgraded.
- Don't include changes that are purely internal. The CHANGELOG should be a
  useful summary for people upgrading their application, not a replication
  of the commit log.

## Unreleased

- Drop support for Ruby < 2.7
